## Intro

CZSlidingMenu is a swiping menu works like Mailbox's swipe function. It provides both left and right swipe blocks as well as long swipe blocks.
Enjoy!

## Requirements

CZSlidingMenu works on iOS 5.x+ version and is compatible with only ARC projects. It depends on the following Apple frameworks, which should already be included with most Xcode templates:

* Foundation.framework
* UIKit.framework
* CoreGraphics.framework
* QuartzCore.framework

You will need LLVM 3.0 or later in order to build ToastButton. 

## Usage

Directly add the `CZSlidingMenu.h` and `CZSlidingMenu.m` source files to your project.

1. Download the [latest code version](https://github.com/carlWattpad/CZSlidingMenu/archive/master.zip) or add the repository as a git submodule to your git-tracked project. 
2. Open your project in Xcode, than drag and drop `CZSlidingMenu.h` and `CZSlidingMenu.m` onto your project (use the "Product Navigator view"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project. 
3. Include CZSlidingMenu wherever you need it with `#import "CZSlidingMenu.h"`.
